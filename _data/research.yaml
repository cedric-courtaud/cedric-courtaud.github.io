title: Research Interest
content: |
  I have diverse research interests including operating systems, real-time systems, and multi-core architectures.
  My research essentially revolves around the practical aspects of real-time systems.

  During my PhD, I worked on the problem of memory interference in multi-core processors.
  Memory interference occurs when several applications running in parallel on the same hardware platform contend for memory system hardware components.
  Such components include shared caches, memory controllers, buses or DRAM banks.
  Memory interference is a serious obstacle to the adoption of cheap multi-core hardware platforms for real-time systems, as they are causing significant and hard-to-predict delays to co-running applications.
  As part of my PhD, I developed some tools and microbenchmarks to study and predict the impact of memory interference on applications runtime depending on their memory usage patterns.

  At MPI-SWS, I am working on the design and implementation of time predictable operating system mechanisms as part of the [TOROS](https://toros.mpi-sws.org) project.
